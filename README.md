# ðŸ“Š PageRank: The Math Behind Google Search

Welcome to this project exploring **PageRank**, the famous algorithm that powered the early success of Google Search. This project is part of the *Math for Developers* course, designed to showcase the power of applied mathematics in solving real-world problems.

## ðŸ§  What is PageRank?

**PageRank** is an algorithm that assigns a numerical weight to each web page, measuring its relative importance in a network of linked documents. It treats the web as a graph, where pages are nodes and hyperlinks are directed edges. Using linear algebra and the concept of a *random surfer*, the algorithm iteratively computes a probability distribution over the web graph â€” revealing which pages are most influential.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Explain the **mathematical intuition** behind PageRank  
- Derive the **PageRank formula** using concepts like:
  - Graphs & adjacency matrices
  - Stochastic matrices
  - Eigenvectors & linear systems
- Implement PageRank **from scratch** in Python
- Compare results with built-in tools like `networkx`
- Visualize how link structures affect rankings
