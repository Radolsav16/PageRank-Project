## ðŸ§  What is PageRank?

**PageRank** is an algorithm that assigns a numerical weight to each web page, measuring its relative importance in a network of linked documents. It treats the web as a graph, where pages are nodes and hyperlinks are directed edges. Using linear algebra and the concept of a *random surfer*, the algorithm iteratively computes a probability distribution over the web graph â€” revealing which pages are most influential.
